## Operations · Revenue · Business Systems

I've never really been someone who fits one lane. I've built companies, led 
teams, sold, trained, filed a patent, launched products, and figured out 
whatever was in between — usually all at once.

Most of my career has been spent in the deep end. Not managing from a 
distance, but actually in it — diagnosing what's broken, building the fix, 
and making sure it holds when real people and real pressure get behind it. 
I've built remote sales infrastructure for 500+ operators, helped scale a 
venture to $7M profit in its first 18 months, and worked across insurance, 
manufacturing, and consumer goods along the way.

I'm equally comfortable in the weeds or at the whiteboard. Strategy means 
nothing if the team can't run it, so I stay close to the execution no matter 
what level I'm operating at.

## What I actually do
- Build operating systems for remote and growth-stage teams
- Design revenue architecture and fix unit economics
- Create training and enablement that actually sticks
- Diagnose why execution is drifting and fix the root cause
- CRM and systems infrastructure — GoHighLevel, dialers, custom stacks

## Selected work
- Built a remote sales training system from scratch — 500+ operators, fully 
  distributed
- Designed a sales performance operating system that holds under real pressure
- Cross-vertical case studies — insurance, consumer goods, manufacturing, 
  I've built in all of it
