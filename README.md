## Operations · Revenue · Business Systems

I build things that actually work when you put real people and real pressure behind them.
Most of my career has been spent figuring out what's broken, fixing it, and making sure it doesn't break the same way twice. I've built remote sales infrastructure for 500+ operators, helped scale a venture to $7M profit in its first 18 months, and worked across insurance, manufacturing, and consumer goods — including a provisional patent along the way.
I'm equally comfortable in the weeds or at the whiteboard. Strategy means nothing if the team can't execute it, so I stay close to both.

# What I actually do

- Build operating systems for remote and growth-stage teams
- Design revenue architecture and fix unit economics
- Create training and enablement that sticks
- Diagnose why execution is drifting and fix the root cause
- CRM and systems infrastructure — GoHighLevel, dialers, custom stacks

# Selected work

- Built a remote sales training system from scratch — 500+ operators, fully distributed
- Designed a sales performance operating system that actually holds under real pressure
- Cross-vertical case studies — from insurance to consumer goods to manufacturing, I've built in all of it
